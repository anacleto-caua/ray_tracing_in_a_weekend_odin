# A simple implementation of cpu Raycasting

# Core takes:
- Odin is beautifull, easy and have a great core library
- I wish I knew about [Raycast in a weekend](https://www.realtimerendering.com/raytracing/Ray%20Tracing%20in%20a%20Weekend.pdf) before
- PPM is a lovely format
- Math is beautifull

# My best render yet
